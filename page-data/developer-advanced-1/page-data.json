Developer intermediate focuses on being able to use the environment well enough to develop and deploy a basic cloud-native application. Developer advanced focuses on using the SDLC to iteratively develop, deliver, operate, secure, and manage applications. As a team executes the key agile ceremonies using the [Garage Method](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/cloud/), it's important for developers and architects to understand what is involved in moving software components consistently and reliably from *dev* to *test* and on to *production*.\n\nThese learning tasks are more advanced than those from the developer intermediate experience, so take your time and do some research on the topic before jumping into the task.\n\n<Tabs>\n\n<Tab label=\"Over the Web\">\n\n## Before the Workshop\n\nPlease complete these tasks before attending the first session. This will help you get started quickly with the practical exercises.\n\n| Task                            | Description         | Link        | Time    |\n| --------------------------------| ------------------  |:----------- |---------|\n| Welcome Message | Welcome to Cloud-Native Workshop  | [Introduction](/getting-started/introduction) | 5 mins |\n| Prerequisites | Install the prerequisite tools  | [Setup Prerequisites](/getting-started/prereqs) | 10 mins |\n| Sandbox Access | Validate access to your Development Cluster |  [Validate](/getting-started/checksetup) | 10 min |\n| **Continous Delivery** | | | |\n| Continous Delivery (CD) | Overview | [CD](/developer-intermediate/continuous-delivery) | 15 mins |\n| CD Implementation | Application Delivery with Gitops | [Gitops](/developer-advanced-1/gitops) | 15 mins |\n| **Database Integration** | | | |\n| Cloudant | Integrate Backend with Cloudant Database | [Cloudant](/developer-advanced-1/inventory-cloudant) | 15 mins |\n| MongoDB | Integrate Backend with MongoDB Database | [MongoDB](/developer-advanced-1/inventory-mongodb) | 15 mins |\n| Postgres | Integrate Backend with Postgres Database | [Postgres](/developer-advanced-1/inventory-postgres) | 15 mins |\n| **Authentication** | | | |\n| App ID | Secure the solution with App ID  | [App ID](/developer-advanced-1/inventory-appid/) | 15 mins |\n| **API Consumption** | | | |\n| Using API's in Client Applications | Overview | [OpenAPI and Swagger](/developer-advanced-1/swagger-and-openapi/) | |\n| **Contract Testing** | | | |\n| Overview | Brief overview of Contract Testing | [Contract Testing](/developer-advanced-1/contract-testing-overview/) | 15 mins |\n| Hands On Lab | Incorporate contract testing within inventory app | [Inventory Contract Testing](/developer-advanced-1/inventory-contract-testing/) | 30 mins |\n| **Advanced Monitoring and Logging** | | | |\n| Monitoring | Advanced Monitoring with Sysdig | [Advanced Monitoring](/developer-advanced-1/monitoring/) | 30 mins |\n| Log Management | Advanced Log Management with LogDNA | [Advanced Log Management](/developer-advanced-1/log-management/) | 30 mins |\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"Self Paced\">\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"In Person\">\n</Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\nOnce you have completed these tasks, you will have completed the learning requirements for both the intermediate and the advanced Experience.
