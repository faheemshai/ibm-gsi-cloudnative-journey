To do so, navigate to your cluster in the _IBM Cloud Console_, click on the **Access** tab and\nfollow the instructions to login from the command line.\n\n- To open the Dashboard from the environment you are configured with, use the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli#dashboard).\n    ```\n    igc dashboard\n    ```\n\n### Access the tools URLs\n\n- To list the ingress endpoints for all of the installed tools, use the [Developer Tools CLI](../getting-started/cli) to run the following command:\n    ```bash\n    igc endpoints -n tools\n    ```\n\n- This will return the ingress URLs for all of the tools installed in the Developer Tools cluster. You can then select the URL to open the tools' dashboard directly:\n    ```bash\n   ? Endpoints in the 'tools' namespace. Select an endpoint to launch the default browser or 'Exit'.\n\n     1) Exit\n     2) developer-dashboard - http://dashboard.garage-dev-ocp4-c-518489-0143c5dd31acd8e030a1d6e0ab1380e3-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud\n     3) argocd-server - https://argocd-tools.gsi-learning-ocp4-clu-7ec5d722a0ab3f463fdc90eeb94dbc70-0001.eu-gb.containers.appdomain.cloud\n     4) artifactory - https://artifactory-tools.gsi-learning-ocp4-clu-7ec5d722a0ab3f463fdc90eeb94dbc70-0001.eu-gb.containers.appdomain.cloud\n     5) dashboard - https://dashboard-tools.gsi-learning-ocp4-clu-7ec5d722a0ab3f463fdc90eeb94dbc70-0001.eu-gb.containers.appdomain.cloud\n     6) developer-dashboard - http://dashboard.garage-dev-ocp4-c-518489-0143c5dd31acd8e030a1d6e0ab1380e3-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud\n   (Move up and down to reveal more choices)\n     Answer:\n    ```\n\n### Credentials\n\nIn the future, the Dashboard tools will be linked using a single sign-on (SSO) service.\nMeantime, the CLI includes a command to list the tools' credentials.\n\n- To list the credentials for all of the installed tools, use the [Developer Tools CLI](../getting-started/cli) to run the following command:\n    ```bash\n    igc credentials\n    ```\n- The command lists the `userid` and `password` for each tool installed.
