Let's debug the `hyper-drive` deployment so that we can reach light speed again.\n\nHere are some tips to help you solve the Hyper Drive:\n\n- Check the description of the `deployment`.\n- Get and save the logs of one of the broken `pods`.\n- Are the correct `ports` assigned.\n- Make sure your `labels` and `selectors` are correct.\n- Check to see if the `Probes` are correctly working.\n- To fix the deployment, save then modify the yaml file for redeployment.\n\n## Solution\n\n### Setup environment\n\n- Execute the command to create the Deployement, Namespace, Service below definition.\n\n ```shell script\n  oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/learning-cloudnative-101/master/lab-setup/lab-5-debug-k8s-setup.yaml\n  ```\n- Check the status of the POD.\n\n ```\n  oc get pods -n {DEV_NAMESPACE}\n  ```\n- Check the description of the deployment.\n\n ```\n  oc describe deployment hyper-drive -n {DEV_NAMESPACE}\n  ```\n- Save logs for broken pod.\n\n ```\n  oc logs <pod name> -n {DEV_NAMESPACE} > /home/cloud_user/debug/broken-pod-logs.log\n  ```\nIn the description you will see the following is wrong:\n  - Selector and Label names do not match.\n  - The Probe is TCP instead of HTTP Get.\n  - The Service Port is 80 instead of 8080.\n\n- To fix problem, can't do oc edit on deployement, need to delete and recreate the deployment.
