Developer intermediate focuses on being able to use the environment well enough to develop and deploy a basic cloud-native application. Developer advanced focuses on using the SDLC to iteratively develop, deliver, operate, secure, and manage applications. As a team executes the key agile ceremonies using the [Garage Method](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/cloud/), it's important for developers and architects to understand what is involved in moving software components consistently and reliably from *dev* to *test* and on to *production*.\n\nThese learning tasks are more advanced than those from the developer intermediate experience, so take your time and do some research on the topic before jumping into the task.\n\n<Tabs>\n\n<Tab label=\"Over the Web\">\n\n## Before the Workshop\n\nPlease complete these tasks before attending the first session. This will help you get started quickly with the practical exercises.\n\n| Task                            | Description         | Link        | Time    |\n| --------------------------------| ------------------  |:----------- |---------|\n| Welcome Message | Welcome to Cloud-Native Workshop  | [Introduction](/getting-started/introduction) | 5 mins |\n| Prerequisites | Install the prerequisite tools  | [Setup Prerequisites](/getting-started/prereqs) | 10 mins |\n| Sandbox Access | Validate access to your Development Cluster |  [Validate](/getting-started/checksetup) | 10 min |\n| **DevSecOps** | | | |\n| DevSecOps | DevSecOps Overview | [DevSecOps](/developer-advanced-2/devsecops) | 15 mins |\n| Advanced Container Security | DevSecOps with Aqua CSP | [Container Security](/developer-advanced-2/devsecops-aquasec-csp) | 20 mins |\n| Advanced Container Security | DevSecOps with Twistlock | [Container Security](/developer-advanced-2/devsecops-twistlock) | 20 mins |\n| Add security to CI/CD | DevSecOps with Trivy | [Incorporate CI/CD](/developer-advanced-2/devsecops-trivy) | 30 mins |\n| **Operators** | | | |\n| Operator Overview | Operators are a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application |[Operator](/developer-advanced-2/operator-overview) | 15 min |\n| Operator Labs | Developing operator step by step |[Operator Labs](/developer-advanced-2/operator-lab/lab) | 45 min |\n| **Advanced Application Modernization** | | | |\n| Application Modernization Process | Drivers and Process for modernization of legacy application | [Overview](/developer-advanced-2/appmod-overview/) | 20 mins|\n| Modernize Legacy Application  | Scan the Legacy Application (Step - 1) | [Scan](/developer-advanced-2/appmod-exercise-part1/) | 30 mins|\n| Analyze with TA | Analyze the Legacy Application (Step - 2)|[Analyze](/developer-advanced-2/appmod-exercise-part2/) | 30 mins|\n| Migrate to Openshift | Migrate the Legacy Appliation (Step - 3)|[Migrate](/developer-advanced-2/appmod-exercise-part3/) | 30 mins|\n| **Advanced Microservices Techniques** | | | |\n| Code Engine | IBM Managed Serverless Kubernetes Platform |[Code Engine Application Deployment](/developer-advanced-2/code-engine/) | 30 mins|\n| Servimesh & KNative | | | |\n| Modify inventory application with service mesh | | | |\n| Kiali, jaeger | | | |\n| Events with Kafka | | | |\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"Self Paced\">\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"In Person\">\n</Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\nOnce you have completed these tasks, you will have completed the learning requirements for both the intermediate and the advanced Experience.
