Deploy the following CRD:\n```\n  $ oc create -f deploy/crds/example_v1alpha1_nginx_crd.yaml\n```\n\n#### Build and run the Operator.\n\nThere are two ways to build and run the Operator:\n  - As a Pod inside a Kubernetes cluster.\n  - As a Go/Helm/Ansible program outside the cluster using the operator-sdk up command. \n\n##### Build the nginx-operator image and push it to a registry:\n\n```  \n  $ operator-sdk build docker.io/$DOCKER_USERNAME/nginx-operator:v0.0.1\n```\n\n```\n  $ docker login docker.io -u $DOCKER_USERNAME -p $DOCKER_PASSWORD\n```\n\n``` \n  $ docker push docker.io/$DOCKER_USERNAME/nginx-operator:v0.0.1\n```    \n      \n##### Deployment manifests are generated in the deploy/operator.yaml file. \n  \nThe deployment image in this file needs to be modified from the placeholder REPLACE_IMAGE to the previous built image. To do this, run:\n\n```\n  $ sed -i 's|REPLACE_IMAGE|docker.io/$DOCKER_USERNAME/nginx-operator:v0.0.1|g' deploy/operator.yaml\n```\nNote: If you are performing these steps on OSX, use the following sed command instead:\n\n```\n  $ sed -i \"\" 's|REPLACE_IMAGE|docker.io/$DOCKER_USERNAME/nginx-operator:v0.0.1|g' deploy/operator.yaml\n```\n\n\n##### Deploy the nginx-operator:\n\n\n```\n  $ oc create -f deploy/service_account.yaml\n  $ oc create -f deploy/role.yaml\n  $ oc create -f deploy/role_binding.yaml\n  $ oc create -f deploy/operator.yaml\n```\n\n##### Verify that the nginx-operator is up and running:\n\n```\n  $ oc get deployment\n```\n\n#### Deploy the Nginx CR.\n\n  Apply the Nginx CR that you modified earlier:\n\n```\n  $ oc apply -f deploy/crds/example.com_v1alpha1_nginx_cr.yaml\n```\n\n  Ensure that the nginx-operator creates the Deployment for the CR:\n```\n  $ oc get deployment\n```\n  Check the Pods to confirm two replicas were created:\n```\n  $ oc get pods\n```\n  \n#### Note:\nThe result is actually a failure. Well, that is frustrating - helm install reported that the chart was deployed. From a helm perspective I think this is fair since it did its job and the objects have been created in the environment, however, the pod was unable to come up. \nThis was because of the container is attempting to run as root which is naughty. We find this out by inspecting the pod logs.\n\n```\n[warn] 1#1: the \"user\" directive makes sense only if the master process runs with super-user privileges, ignored in

recreate the POD\n\n ![Model](../images/ApplyCR.png)\n\n#### Update the replicaCount\n\nChange the spec.replicaCount field from 2 to 3, remove the spec.service field, and apply the change:\n\n```\n  $ cat deploy/crds/example.com_v1alpha1_nginx_cr.yaml\n\n  $ oc apply -f deploy/crds/example.com_v1alpha1_nginx_cr.yaml\n```\n\nConfirm that the Operator changes the Deployment size:\n\n```\n  $ oc get deployment\n```\n\nCheck that the Service port is set to the default 80:\n\n```\n  $ oc get service\n```\n\n#### Create Route for the service & Access via browser\n\n- Create the Route for the example nginx service\n\n![Model](../images/RouteCreate.png)\n\n![Model](../images/RouteAccess.png)\n\n- Access the route url from the browser for verification\n\n![Model](../images/NginxAccess.png)\n\nThis demonstrates how you use operator sdk to develop the helm based operator for the nginx web server which is successfully installed and working\n\n#### Clean up the resources:\n\n```\n  $ oc delete -f deploy/crds/example.com_v1alpha1_nginx_cr.yaml\n  $ oc delete -f deploy/operator.yaml\n  $ oc delete -f deploy/role_binding.yaml\n  $ oc delete -f deploy/role.yaml\n  $ oc delete -f deploy/service_account.yaml\n  $ oc delete -f deploy/crds/example_v1alpha1_nginx_crd.yaml\n```\n\n## Write your own operator\n\nTo write your own operator you can use existing tools:\n- KUDO (Kubernetes Universal Declarative Operator),\n- kubebuilder,\n- Metacontroller using custom WebHooks,\n- the Operator Framework.\n\nThe Operator SDK provides the following workflow to develop a new Operator:\n\nThe following workflow is for a new Go operator:\n- Create a new operator project using the SDK Command Line Interface(CLI)\n- Define new resource APIs by adding Custom Resource Definitions(CRD)\n- Define Controllers to watch and reconcile resources\n- Write the reconciling logic for your Controller using the SDK and controller-runtime APIs\n- Use the SDK CLI to build and generate the operator deployment manifests\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"a4020ed7be4288d3bcd2352045364d5b","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":1037},"frontmatter":{"title":"Operator SDK Step by
