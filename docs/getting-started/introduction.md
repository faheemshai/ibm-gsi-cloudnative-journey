## Cloud-Native Learning Journey

The foundation of any modern cloud solution is the **cloud-native** application. This core concept is formulated around an open and flexible platform and programming models that enable a wide range of solutions to be constructed and delivered to users.
   
IBM Cloud and Red Hat aim to help developers and architects realize the value of cloud computing by delivering a world-class open platform that supports enterprise software and **Cloud-Native** applications.

This learning journey has been designed to take developers through a step by step process to build strong skills in both the programming models IBM is aligned towards and the underlying platform, Red Hat OpenShift, a multi/hybrid cloud Kubernetes environment that provides developers extreme flexibility to build solutions.

This Learning Journey targets the following [personas](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/practice_personas/):
- **The Cloud-Native Developer**.
- **The DevSecOps Engineer**.
- **The Ops Engineer and the SRE ([Site Reliability Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering))**.

This Learning Journey focuses on the **Cloud Enterprise Sandbox**, which provides full access to an IBM Cloud **Red Hat OpenShift Cloud Platform** development cluster including a set of CNCF open-source software development lifecycle tools which show the IBM Cloud usage for full DevSecOps development.

The Learning Journey agenda is broken into **Foundation**, **Intermediate** and **Advanced** developer techniques, and then extends with **Application Modernization** and **Application Integration**.

With the **Cloud-Native Journey** you can choose how you want to use the **Cloud Enterprise Sandbox**. You can use the self-paced agenda or work with the Cloud Ecosystem Team to have a remote workshop model. The self-paced model will enable longer-term learning with the **Cloud Enterprise Sandbox**.
